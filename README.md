# TeraToolbox module for lfg
a module that posts in game lfg to discord in real time.
this module is already implanted in [discord lfg bot](https://github.com/Citoyasha/Tera-discord-lfg-bot) (EU mystel only).
(this is a reworked version of the old tera lfger module, the code was sloppy & module wasn't very useful so i reworked it.)
## Installation

 1. Open config.json inside Tera-LFGer module folder using notepad or any other text editor sofware.
 2. Put your token in there (could be either a bot token or your token but better connect to a discord bot)
 3. Open Teratoolbox and this message will show up `logged in!` if it doesn't re-check your token.
